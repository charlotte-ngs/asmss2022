## Description
The following descriptions are taken from the course catalog

### Applied Statistical Methods in Animal Science
Genomic selection is currently the method of choice for improving the genetic potential of selection candidates in livestock breeding programs. This lecture introduces the reason why regression cannot be used in genomic selection. Alternatives to regression analysis that are suitable for genomic selection are presented. The concepts introduced are illustrated by excersises in R.

The students are familiar with the properties of multiple linear regression and they are able to analyse simple data sets using regression methods. The students know why multiple linear regression cannot be used for genomic selection. The students know the statistical methods used in genomic selection, such as BLUP-based approaches, Bayesian procedures and LASSO. The students are able to solve simple exercise problems using the statistical framework R.


## Questions
Questions can be asked during the lecture and during the exercise hour or via e-mail:
